 * Wrapper to provide C99 stdint types like uint8_t, uintptr_t, int64_t, etc.
 * even on Windows via MSVC.
 *
 * This header is far from complete and only a stopgap solution to move
 * further with more important issues.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Make this solution less hacky - eventually use poc. Currently
 *             only uintptr_t is used...
