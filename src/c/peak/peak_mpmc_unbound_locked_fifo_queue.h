/**

 *
 * Multiple producer multiple consumer queue which dynamically grows and shrinks
 * by pushing and poping it. Nodes are enqueued and dequeued in fifo order.
 * Locks are used to protect the producer and consumer end to minimize
 * sharing as long as the queue isn't empty or only contains one value node.
 *
 * All functions other than the create and destroy functions can be called
 * concurrently and multiple times from multiple threads.
 *
 * @attention All functions other than create expect a valid (initialized, non
 *            NULL) queue to operate on.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Add error return code documentation.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Re-evaluate if it is better to keep all memory management out of
 *             the queues functions. Then the user would need to trypop the
 *             queue in a sequential manner without any new nodes enqueued
 *             concurrently so no still remaining nodes aren't freed.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Decide if to use reference counting for the queue context in 
 *             the future to make context ownership and memory management
 *             less error-prone.
