 *
 * Multiple producer multiple consumer queue which dynamically grows and shrinks
 * by pushing and poping it. Nodes are enqueued and dequeued in fifo order.
 * Locks are used to protect the producer and consumer end to minimize
 * sharing as long as the queue isn't empty or only contains one value node.
 *
 * All functions other than the create and destroy functions can be called
 * concurrently and multiple times from multiple threads.
 *
 * @attention All functions other than create expect a valid (initialized, non
 *            NULL) queue to operate on.
 *
 * TODO: @todo Add error return code documentation.
