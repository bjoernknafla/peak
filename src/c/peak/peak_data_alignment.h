/**
 * @file
 *
 * Macros to set alignment attributes for static/global variables and
 * data types.
 *
 * Functions to check if a memory address is correctly aligned.
 *
 * @attention It depends on the platforms language ABI and the compiler
 *            if the alignment specified for a type is only used for
 *            static / global data or also for data on the stack or function
 *            arguments.
 * See http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3942/data_alignment_part_1.php
 * See http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3975/data_alignment_part_2_objects_on_.php
 * See http://developer.amd.com/documentation/articles/pages/1213200696.aspx
 * See Steven Goodwin, Cross-Platform Game Programming, Charles River Media, 2005
 * See MSDN Windows Data Alignment on IPF, x86, and x64 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa290049(VS.71).aspx
 * See Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory - but beware of code error in
 * aligned alloc (reserving 1 Byte but storing 4 Bytes for malloc bookkeeping).
 *
 * SSE vector instructions work on 16byte aligned data
 * Data alignment also important to enable atomicity of memory access
 *
 * Static Data
 * Specifying the alignment of a member var forces the compiler to align it
 * relative to the start of the struct it belongs to.
 * The alignment of a struct has to be a multiple of the least common multiple
 * of the alignment of its member fields.
