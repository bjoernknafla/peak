    /**
     * When a dependency is fulfilled - its internal counter reaches zero - it 
     * can enqueue a user set job into a queue and it informs waiting threads 
     * (dependent threads or dependent jobs) about it.
     *
     * The recommended use for peak dependency is to group jobs with it, so the
     * jobs increase the dependency when they are enqueued and decrease it when 
     * they completed their work which in turn triggers the zero job which 
     * continues the workflow of the program without any blocking.
     *
     * It can be used to group peak jobs that work on the same problem, they
     * increase the dependency and after completing their work decrease it so a 
     * dependent job (it's thread) can wait on the dependency to be informed
     * the moment all jobs of the group are done.
     * 
     * Waiting for a dependency to be fulfilled can result in locking up all 
     * threads and therefore kind of deadlock the whole program - be careful 
     * when waiting on dependencies and better use the continuation job not to 
     * wait on a group of jobs to finish but to start new work via the zero job 
     * without any blocking at all.

     * TODO: @todo Decide if to remove the job after enqueueing it or if it is
     *             copied and enqueued whenever the dependency hits zero.
